The use of an internal image server to make [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) being able to work with images served locally is based on a test case available at https://iiif.github.io/training/intro-to-iiif/. Copyrights of images respect the practice of each library or stakeholder. The data are available in OA on Nakala (CNRS, Human-Num, https://mark16-snsf-prima-project.nakala.fr) and DaSCH (Basel, CH, https://admin.dasch.swiss/project/n47nDVTHR2W9U8yjEIcj2Q).

The first implementation of this API has been developed by __Jonathan Barda__ and __Silvano Aldà__, and the present version has been developed by __Silvano Aldà__.

The PI of the 2018-2023 SNSF MARK16 project is __Claire Clivaz__ and the team was composed of __Mina Monier__, post-doc, **Priscille Marschall**, post doc, __Elisa Nury__, research scientist, with __Jonathan Barda__ and __Silvano Aldà__, Core-IT software developers. The project is hosted at Digital Humanities +, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.
