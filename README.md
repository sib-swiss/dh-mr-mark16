This manuscript viewer makes it possible to view manuscripts along with their transcripts and translations.

The use of an internal image server to make [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) being able to work with images served locally is based on a test case available at https://iiif.github.io/training/intro-to-iiif/. Copyrights of images respect the practice of each library or stakeholder. The data are available in OA on Nakala (CNRS, Human-Num, https://mark16-snsf-prima-project.nakala.fr) and DaSCH (Basel, CH, https://admin.dasch.swiss/project/n47nDVTHR2W9U8yjEIcj2Q).

The first implementation of this API has been developed by **Jonathan Barda** and **Silvano Aldà**, and the present version has been developed by **Silvano Aldà**.

The PI of the 2018-2023 SNSF MARK16 project is **Claire Clivaz** with a team composed of **Mina Monier**, post-doc, **Priscille Marschall**, post doc, **Elisa Nury**, research scientist, with **Jonathan Barda** and **Silvano Aldà**, Core-IT software developers. The project is hosted at Digital Humanities +, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.
