            <p>Welcome to the MARK16 manuscript room. It is the first part of a <em>virtual research environment</em> (VRE) devoted to the last chapter of the Gospel according to Mark, developed in the framework of the Swiss National Science Foundation PRIMA project <a href="http://p3.snf.ch/project-179755" target="_blank">MARK16</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The users will find in it an open-ended selection of manuscripts and/or transcriptions for the study of Mark 16. Translations are also provided for ancient languages other than Greek and Latin, beside some Greek and Latin non biblical material, like commentaries. . It aims at building a bridge between scholars engaged in New Testament textual criticism and exegesis by providing material focusing on a chapter well known for its diversity in evidence and readings through centuries. Being inspired by the development of the <a href="http://egora.uni-muenster.de/intf/projekte/ecm_en.shtml" target="_blank"><em>Editio Critica Maior</em></a>, it provides materials in several languages and from different sources.</p>            
            <br>
            <p>
                This project is led in privileged partnership with the <em>New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room</em> (INTF, Münster), and we are particularly grateful to Dr. Gregory Paulson for the constant dialogue we have around the NTVMR, created by Troy Griffitts, and our project. 
                The content of the MARK16 manuscript room is provided in partnership with several colleagues, academic institutions and libraries, whose logos stand on the concerned pages. We are enormously thankful to all of them. Each webpage indicates who transcribed, encoded and/or translated the material, entirely available in license <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.fr" target="_blank">CC BY 4.0</a>. 
                The data are stored in a collection of the open public depository <a href="https://www.nakala.fr/" target="_blank">Nakala</a>, accompanied with metadata, which follows the Dublin Core categories. We are grateful to our <a href="https://www.huma-num.fr/" target="_blank">Huma-Num</a> partner for this collaboration that allows our data to be harvested by the SSH research tool <a href="https://isidore.science/" target="_blank">Isidore</a>.

                As the Principal Investigator of this project, I would like to acknowledge the talents and the efforts of Dr. Mina Monier, the <em>cheville ouvrière</em> of this manuscript room. 
                My gratitude extends to our software developers, Jean-Bernard Dugied who started the web beta application, and in particular to Jonathan Barda, member of Core-IT (SIB), who gave to it its decisive shape, in collaboration with Silvano Aldà (Core-IT, SIB). 
                The beta version was published in September 2020, and submitted to scholarship for feedback. 
                We are proud to release now an extended version of the API. Last but not least, nothing would happen in the projects of our <em>Digital Humanities</em> + group without the constant support of our SIB Core-IT colleagues, notably Vassilios Ioannidis.
            </p>
